# Apple broke binary compatibility between SDK 10.5 and 10.6:
# symbols _SCPreferencesCreate, SCDynamicStoreCreate were "copied"
# from SystemConfiguration to IOKit. Thus in order to support 10.5
# system need to force using those symbols from SystemConfigution
# during build on SDK 10.6. This is achieved by placing SystemConfigution
# framework *before* IOKit (qmake merges frameworks in linker commandline
# into opposite side as for libraries).
